# Hi there, I'm Jaeheon Shim ðŸ‘‹

### I'm a self-taught software developer and computer science enthusiast
---
I'm currently living in the United States. I mainly write code in Java, but I also spend a considerable amount of time developing web applications and working with C++. My primary interests include the study of data structures and algorithms, and the simulation of natural/mathematical phenomena using computer science.

Outside of computer science, I enjoy reading in my free time.

My pronouns are: he/him
